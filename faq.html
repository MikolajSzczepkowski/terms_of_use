				<p class="col-xs-11 col-xs-pull-1">When the film was originally released in 1977, it was simply referred to as "Star Wars"; though supposedly, George Lucas had intended to include "Episode IV" and "A New Hope" in the opening crawl, but Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation did not want Lucas to do so because they thought it would confuse audiences, since there were never any other episodes released before it.</p>

			<h3>Were the Biggs and Luke scenes on Tatooine originally part of the finished film?</h3>

				</div>
				<p class="col-xs-11 col-xs-pull-1">They were supposedly never part of any release of the film, having been edited out of the film long before the special effects, sound, and musical score were completed, and long before the first test screening. Though many fans claim to have seen them (as children, or on televised versions), they were never officially available until the CD-ROM "Behind the Magic" was released in the mid 1990s. Some photos from those scenes did, however, appear in books, such as The Star Wars Storybook, and the Marvel comic book adaptation.</p>

			<h3>What academy is Uncle Owen referring to when he tells Luke he can "go to the academy next year"?</h3>
			<div class="col-xs-12">
				<div class="col-xs-1">
					<span>3.</span>
				</div>
				<p class="col-xs-11 col-xs-pull-1">While the film does not specify, the novelization of the film indicates to what academy Luke and Owen were referring. A deleted scene wherein Luke talks with his recently graduated friend Biggs indicates that Biggs was planning, along with several friends, to jump ship and seek out the Rebel Alliance after beginning their tours of duty on the vessel Rand Ecliptic. Luke already knows this information when he has the discussion with his uncle, but the text of the missing scene, as well as Luke's later talk with Ben Kenobi, show that Luke was very uncertain of the idea of joining with the Alliance despite his voiced opposition to the Galactic Empire, and likely was not desiring to attend the Academy for the same reasons as his friend (though Biggs did not necessarily go to the Academy with the intention of joining the Alliance and may have heard about it while in school and decided where his true loyalties lay)..</p>

			<h3>If Luke is supposed to be hidden from the Empire, why was he given the name "Skywalker"?</h3>
			<div class="col-xs-12">
				<div class="col-xs-1">
					<span>4.</span>
				</div>
				<p class="col-xs-11 col-xs-pull-1">It would, at first, seem unwise for Obi-Wan to hide a child with his adoptive parents and give him the same surname as the father from whom he were trying to hide the child. However, there are more sides to the story. In the film, the first time Luke is identified by his whole name is many scenes after he has agreed to go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan, so the audience cannot assume that he has always gone by the name of "Skywalker". Furthermore, as seen in the third film, Revenge of the Sith, Luke was delivered to Owen and Beru Lars by Obi-Wan Kenobi. We never learned what Obi-Wan has told them about Luke's family history.</p>

			<h3>Why doesn't Obi-Wan remember the droids?</h3>
			<div class="col-xs-12">
				<div class="col-xs-1">
					<span>5.</span>
				</div>
				<p class="col-xs-11 col-xs-pull-1">The only thing Obi-Wan ever says is that he doesn't "seem to remember ever owning a droid." This does not imply that he isn't familiar with them, merely that Luke saying "Then the droid does belong to you" is an untrue statement. It's possible that, as with other secrets, Obi-Wan doesn't reveal quite everything at first brush, and that what he does reveal could be seen as true from certain points of view. The whole setup is a lie from R2-D2, who claims to be the property of Obi-Wan, when in fact he's been in the possession of the Organas (and the Alliance) for a long time. R2's lie is just to get off the homestead and on with his mission.</p>
